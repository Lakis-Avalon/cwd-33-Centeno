            <h3>Jiang Wanyin, Sandu Sengshou</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Jiang Wanyin's life is marked by a complex mix of familial love, personal insecurity, and resentment, which ultimately shaped his relationships and decisions.
                Growing up in the Yunmeng Jiang Sect, Jiang Wanyin cared deeply for Wei Wuxian, who was adopted into the family. However, his affection was
                constantly overshadowed by his insecurity. Wei Wuxian's natural talent and charm drew admiration from others, including Jiang Fengmian, 
                their father figure, which unintentionally deepened Jiang Wanyin's feelings of inadequacy. Madam Yu's sharp criticism of Wei Wuxian and her
                insistence that he was a threat to Jiang Wanyin's position as sect heir only added to the tension, fostering a complicated dynamic between the 
                two brothers.
                <br><br>
                When the Wen Clan attacked Lotus Pier, leading to the deaths of Jiang Fengmian and Madam Yu, Jiang Wanyin's grief turned into bitterness. He held Wei Wuxian responsible for their 
                downfall, as Wei Wuxian had defied the Wen Clan and drawn their ire. After the Yunmeng Jiang Sect was rebuilt, Wei Wuxian's decision to protect Wen Qing and Wen Ning—a decision made out of gratitude for their help during their escape from the Wen Clan—deepened the rift between them. 
                Viewing this as a betrayal, Jiang Wanyin declared Wei Wuxian an enemy of the cultivation world and publicly condemned him.
                <br><br>
                As sect leader and known as Sandu Sengshou during the Sunshot Campaign, Jiang Wanyin earned a fearsome reputation.
                Jiang Wanyin's personal grief worsened when his sister, Jiang Yanli, was killed during a battle involving Wei Wuxian. 
                Blaming Wei Wuxian for her death, he took an active role in leading the siege of the Burial Mounds. The siege ended in tragedy with Wei 
                Wuxian's death, leaving their relationship in irreparable ruins.
                <br><br>
                Over the 13 years of Wei Wuxian's death, he became infamous for his ruthless methods, with rumors that those abducted by Yunmeng Jiang never returned. People were afraid of the Jiang Sect reluctant to ask them for help. 
                When Wei Wuxian was resurrected in Mo Xuanyu's body, Jiang Wanyin pursued him relentlessly, still harboring old grudges. During the events leading up to the second siege of the Burial Mounds, Jiang Wanyin discovered two shocking truths: Wei Wuxian had given up his golden core so that Jiang Wanyin could cultivate 
                again, and Wei Wuxian had been framed for many of the crimes that justified the original siege. These revelations deeply conflicted Jiang Wanyin, who was forced to confront the weight of his actions that had defined their enmity.
                Despite these realizations, Jiang Wanyin and Wei Wuxian never reconciled. Jiang Wanyin assisted during the events at the Guanyin Temple, 
                but their relationship remained fractured.
