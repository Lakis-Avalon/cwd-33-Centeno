                                Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji first met when Wei Wuxian attended the Gusu Lan Sect Lectures with other Yunmeng Jiang disciples. 
                                Right at the start, he already broke a rule by smuggling alcohol and not following the curfew. Upon reaching the gates to return, he was intercepted
                                by Lan Wangji who is the sect's second heir and is a known stickler for rules. Wei Wuxian offered him a jar of Emperor's Smile.

                                Wei Wuxian despite knowing how to answer questions in lectures often got into punishments. Lan Wangji supervised his 
                                punishments in the library. Wei Wuxian often teased Lan Wangji during these sessions. They call each other by their
                                birth names - a gesture which is very intimate, even couples do not do this often - Wei Wuxian slipped a yellow book into 
                                Lan Wangji's book. Before Wei Wuxian left Cloud Recesses, he gave Lan Wangji 2 rabbits which he took care of in the 
                                backhills of Cloud Recesses.

                                The next time they meet is during the archery competition hosted by the Wen Sect. Wei Wuxian saw that Lan Wangji's 
                                forehead ribbon was askew so he grabbed it, trying to fix it. This made Lan Wangji upset because Wei Wuxian didn't know
                                the significance of the forehead ribbon and how only family or spouses can only touch it. The author based this on the cliche 
                                that if the male protagonist sees the face of a girl or touches her in some way he has to take responsibility and marry the girl.

                                Wei Wuxian offered to help him but he refused. Later on, they got trapped with the Xuanwu of Slaughter because
                                Wen Chao trapped them in the cave. The two of them worked together and managed to takedown this beast. They spent
                                a few days inside the cave, both injured and Lan Wangji shared his worries about his sect being attacked and his family hurt. 
                                Wei Wuxian asked Lan Wangji to play a song for him to help him sleep. That was the last time they would see each other 
                                before terrible things happen.

                                Wei Wuxian went missing for three months around the start of the Sunshot Campaign. Lan Wangji and Jiang Wanyin looked for him during this time.
                                When the forces of Sunshot Campaign were losing, fierce corpses appeared and attacked only the Wen Cultivators. Wei Wuxian appeared seemingly a changed man.
                                Lan Wangji tells Wei Wuxian that cultivating resentful energy is harmful. Wei Wuxian takes it as Lan Wangji condemning him, and
                                brushes him off. Through the course of the Sunshot Campaign, people think that they are not on good terms.

                                to get him back to "righteous cultivation", but in truth, Lan Wangji wants to protect him.

                                1/3 of all the prey so people got angry for him using "demonic tricks". He ended up wearing a blindfold to 
                                prove to people that he can do better than them with a handicap. He hangs up on a tree somewhere where he ends up
                                noticing someone coming close to him. Wordlessly, he gets manhandled and kissed by this someone and before he could take off 
                                his blindfold, that someone's already gone. He tries to run after the person, but all he sees is Lan Wangji.

                                Wen Remnants got killed. Wei Wuxian died in the backlash when he tried to destroy the Stygian Tiger Tally. 
                                He hid Wen Yuan from the invading cultivators before the siege. When Lan Wangji heard the news, he rushed to 
                                the Burial Mounds with his heavily injured body - 33 whips from the discipline whip - and found Wen Yuan who he 
                                brought back to Cloud Recesses and raised. He gave him the courtesy name Sizhui which means 'to long for' or 
                                'to reminisce'.

                                Wei Wuxian gets resurrected by Mo Xuanyu and fulfills his deal. He tries to avoid the four great clans but he 
                                encounters Jin Rulan who ends up in danger so he makes a flute and summons a fierce corpse to save him which was unexpectedly 
                                Wen Ning. After the fight, he tries to soothe him by playing a calming song from his memory but while he was playing this song, 
                                Lan Wangji grabs him and scrutinizes him. He then continues his playing and sends Wen Ning away. Lan Wangji brings him back to Gusu 
                                since he tried to bluff and say he likes Lan Wangji hoping to make Lan Wangji be disgusted of him. Unbeknownst to him, Lan Wangji 
                                knew it was him and brought him home.

                                if he burned joss papers for him but Lan Wangji did not reply. When they both drank together that night though, Wei Wuxian 
                                discovered how much of a lightweight Lan Wangji is. Lan Wangji ended up acting a bit childish once he woke up again in his drunken 
                                stupor. Lan Wangji offered Wei Wuxian a lot of things like the toy he bought Wen Yuan, as well as money but when Wei Wuxian did not 
                                take them, he says that he won't burn joss paper for him. Lan Wangji did not because Wei Ying is alive. Lan Wangji also ties him up 
                                with his forehead ribbon and shows it to the juniors. The ribbon can only be touched by cultivation partners and family.

                                Wei Wuxian gets a revelation in the Guanyin temple under a hostage situation that Lan Wangji loves him. He learns 
                                of the 33 whip punishment administered on Lan Wangji for defending him against the 33 elders he injured. This is further 
                                proved when Jin Guangyao easily commanded Lan Wangji to disarm himself while he held a wire against Wei Wuxian's neck.
                                Wei Wuxian, upon knowing this immediately blurts out his confession:
                                <br><br>
                                'Lan WangJi! HanGuang-Jun! Back then, I-I really wanted to sleep with you!'
                                <br><br>
                                Jin Guangyao is so shocked that he lets go of Wei Wuxian who immediately hugs Lan Wangji. Wei Wuxian tries to repeat his confession 
                                again but Lan Xichen stops him, stating that it is inappropriate. Further in the temple, Wei Wuxian apologizes for his poor 
                                memory and not knowing Lan Wangji's feelings, but promises to Lan Wangji that he really loves him, there can be no one but him and he 
                                can do anything to him, which Lan Wangji says back to him as well.

                                The characters in WangXian (忘羡) have specific meanings that reflect the essence of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian's relationship:
                                <br>
                                忘 (Wàng) - This character means "forget" or "to not dwell on." It is part of Lan Wangji's courtesy name, 
                                "Wangji" (忘机), which can be interpreted as "forgetting worldly desires" or "free from ulterior motives." 
                                This reflects Lan Wangji's disciplined and virtuous nature.
                                <br>
                                羡 (Xiàn) - This character means "envy," "admire," or "long for." It is part of Wei Wuxian's given name, 
                                "Wuxian" (无羡), which means "without envy" or "to not covet." It reflects his carefree and unrestrained 
                                personality, as well as his lack of concern for societal expectations or material wealth.
                                <br><br>
                                When brought together as 忘羡 (WangXian), the name can be interpreted as "forgetting envy" or "beyond envy." 
                                This conveys the idea of a relationship where both Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian find peace, mutual admiration, and 
                                freedom from the constraints or desires that might otherwise burden them. It beautifully encapsulates the purity and depth of their bond.
