            <h3>Wen Qionglin, Ghost General</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Wen Ning, known as the "Ghost General," was a member of the Dafan Wen Clan. In his youth, he 
                was kind, shy, and soft-spoken, standing out from the cruelty associated with the Wen Clan. 
                During an archery competition, he met Wei Wuxian, who treated him with kindness. Wen Ning 
                later repaid this kindness by saving Wei Wuxian during the Lotus Pier Massacre, helping him 
                escape from the Wen soldiers.
                <br><br>
                After the Sunshot Campaign, the Wen remnants, including Wen Ning and his sister Wen Qing, were
                persecuted and abducted to Qiongqi path. While trapped there, Wen Ning was tortured to near death by the Jin Clan.
                When Wei Wuxian found him near death, he responded to the resentment and ended up killing many Jin guards. 
                Wei Wuxian rescued them and brought them to live in the Burial Mounds with the not-quite-dead Wen Qionglin.
                Eventually Wei Wuxian returned Wen Qionglin's consciousness to his body, but he became a fierce corpse in the end, but sentient.
                While him and Wei Wuxian were going through Quingqi Pass to attend Jin Rulan's 100-day celebration, they were 
                ambushed by Jin Zixun. They managed to fend them off, but in the middle of the fight, Jin Zixuan approached Wei Wuxian who was clearly 
                in survival mode, and Wen Ning who was guarding him clocked Jin Zixuan as a threat. As a fierce corpse, 
                Wen Ning lost control and killed Jin Zixuan, a mistake that led to major consequences. 
                To protect Wei Wuxian and the the remaining Wens, Wen Ning and Wen Qing surrendered themselves to the 
                Jins, but the clans betrayed them, executing both siblings and continuing to plan to siege the 
                Burial Mounds despite promises to spare Wei Wuxian and the Wen remnants.
                <br><br>
                Years later, when Wei Wuxian was resurrected, Wen Ning reappeared to assist him but was controlled by Xue Yang which Wei Wuxian freed him of later. 
                Despite his clan's mistreatment, Wen Ning and the Wen Remnants in the blood pool of the Burial Mounds and Wei 
                Wuxian even saved the lives of cultivators who had previously attacked the Burial Mounds. During this time,
                Wen Ning also realized that Lan Sizhui was A-Yuan, the child Wei Wuxian had once cared for in the Burial Mounds.
                <br><br>
                A pivotal moment in Wen Ning's life was his confrontation with Jiang Cheng about the truth of 
                the golden core transfer. Wen Ning revealed that Wei Wuxian had endured excruciating pain to give Jiang Cheng his golden core,
                allowing him to regain his cultivation. Wen Ning's words were harsh but truthful:
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Young Master Wei had to stay awake and endure extreme pain. Clan Leader Jiang, you have
                    always been a prideful person. You spent your life competing with others. But did you know
                    that you would never have been able to surpass him?"
                </blockquote>
            <p>
                In the aftermath, Wen Ning and Lan Sizhui visited Dafan, reflecting on 
                their shared losses and the tragedies they endured.

                            he is quite timid and just helps with things in the Burial Mounds.
