            <h3>Xiao Xingchen of the Bright Moon and Gentle Breeze</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Xiao Xingchen was a compassionate and idealistic cultivator who sought to make the world a better place 
                but was ultimately drawn into tragedy. A disciple of Baoshan Sanren, a reclusive cultivator, he left her 
                mountain to walk the path of righteousness. His goal was to establish a cultivation sect free from the 
                corruption and politics that plagued the major clans.
                <br><br>
                Xiao Xingchen's life took a tragic turn when he and his close friend, Song Zichen, 
                captured Xue Yang for the massacre of the Chang Clan. However, the Jin Clan released Xue Yang,
                intending to exploit his talents. In retaliation, Xue Yang massacred Song Zichen's sect, 
                Baixue Temple, and blinded Song Zichen. Devastated, Xiao Xingchen gave his own eyes to Song 
                Zichen so that he could see again. Afterwards, Xiao Xingchen disappeared per Song Zichen's 
                emotional outburst, wandering alone, ridden with guilt.
                <br><br>
                He eventually came into Yi City where he encountered a girl with white eyes who pretended to be blind, A-Qing, and 
                an injured man he helped. They all lived together for 2 years happily. The man always made him laugh and told 
                him about his life before of being beaten as a kid all because he did a task for candy. Since then, he always 
                tried to give the man candy whenever he can. Unfortunately, he learns from A-Qing that the man was Xue Yang. 
                He confronted him and all the truth were brought to light. He learned that he killed civilians that Xue Yang 
                disguised as fierce corpses. What broke him, however, after Xue Yang mocking him, saying it was pointless for him to 
                do good, the Jins disregarded them, the Chang Clan they helped withdrew their statement, Baixue Temple was 
                massacred was that the person he just killed, was his friend Song Zichen. He broke into tears of blood as Xue 
                Yang basked in his misery. In his devastation, he slit his throat. Xue Yang preserved his soul in a spirit 
                trapping pouch but the hardship he went through was so gutwrenching and tragic that Xue Yang was never able 
                to revive his body even if he had his soul.

                        <p class="justify">
                            Xiao Xingchen has a unique sword named Shuanghua which has the ability to detect corpse energy. The downside though 
                            is that it cannot distinguish between the living and the dead. Additionally, he also has a remarkable technique
                            called Frost Fall. Xiao Xingchen's attacks can produce ice and when he stabs someone, it leaves a distinguished mark. 
                            During his night hunts with Xue Yang, he accidentally killed many common people because Xue Yang took advantage of his 
                            blindness, he cut off the tongues of the people then used corpse powder on them leading Xiao Xingchen into thinking they are 
                            fierce corpses.

                        Song Zichen and Xiao Xingchen dreamed to make a sect together that is not based on clans but rather on 
                        merit where everyone is equal.

                        This is the half of his epithet with his friend. This essentially means Xiao Xingchen is pure. He is from Baoshan Sanren's mountain and has just 
                        descended from the mountain at the time, still not caring for cultivation politics and the like.
