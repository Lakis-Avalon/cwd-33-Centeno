            <h3>Jin Guangyao</h3>
            <p class="justify">
            Meng Yao, born the illegitimate son of Jin Guangshan and a prostitute, endured a harsh and stigmatized upbringing. Despite his 
            humble origins, he was intelligent and ambitious, striving to rise above the societal scorn directed at him. However, his father, 
            Jin Guangshan, refused to acknowledge him, forcing Meng Yao to carve out his own path. During the rise of the Wen Clan, Meng Yao 
            met Lan Xichen and helped him hide from the Wens, beginning a bond between the two. His abilities and determination were 
            eventually recognized by Nie Mingjue, who acknowledged Meng Yao's talents despite initial prejudice. Meng Yao's strategic mind 
            earned him a place working alongside Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen during the Sunshot Campaign. Their collaboration, though marked by
            mutual distrust on Nie Mingjue's part, became crucial to the war effort. At one point, Nie Mingjue even recommended Meng Yao to 
            Jin Guangshan, believing his father could use someone with Meng Yao's skills—though Meng Yao saw no respite since he couldn't raise 
            above his station just by being in the Jin Clan.
            <br><br>
            Meng Yao's darker nature began to emerge when he murdered Jin Clan disciples who had taken advantage of him. He used a Wen Clan 
            sword to carry out the act and was discovered by Nie Mingjue. When confronted, Meng Yao refused to admit his crimes, and Nie 
            Mingjue, enraged, threatened to kill him. Meng Yao managed to escape by incapacitating Nie Mingjue. During the Sunshot Campaign, 
            Meng Yao served as a spy, sending critical intel about the Wen Clan's movements to Lan Xichen. However, his actions became 
            increasingly complex when he allied himself with Wen Ruohan and became his trusted right-hand man. Nie Mingjue was ambushed due to 
            false intelligence, and he discovered Meng Yao had betrayed their cause. After humiliating him in front of Wen Ruohan and killing 
            his disciples, Meng Yao helped Nie Mingjue escape Nightless City.
            <br><br>
            Meng Yao ultimately turned on Wen Ruohan, stabbing him in the back and securing the Jin Clan's victory in the campaign. 
            Following the war, Jin Guangshan finally acknowledged him as his son, reaping the benefits of Meng Yao's accomplishments without 
            offering any paternal support. Now known as Jin Guangyao, Meng Yao rose to prominence within the Jin Clan but engaged in 
            increasingly sinister activities. These included demonic cultivation experiments with Xue Yang, framing Wei Wuxian for various 
            misdeeds, and orchestrating the death of Nie Mingjue by playing a harmful version of a Lan Clan song. Years after his initial rise,
            Jin Guangyao's schemes were unraveled. Thirteen years post-campaign, it was revealed that he had dismembered Nie Mingjue's corpse to 
            create a fierce corpse even more powerful than Wen Ning, the Ghost General. His secrets were exposed, and his crimes—both against 
            individuals and the cultivation world—made him a public enemy. In his final moments, Meng Yao realized that Nie Huaisang, Nie Mingjue's 
            brother, had orchestrated his downfall from the shadows. Before his death, he expressed that despite all his terrible deeds, Lan Xichen 
            was the one person he never thought of harming, seeing him as his only exception. Jin Guangyao died hated by many, leaving behind a 
            legacy of treachery and tragedy.

                        When Jin Guangyao was exalted as a war hero, Jin Guangshan acknowledged him, but his name says the opposite. Jin Zixuan and Jin Zixun
                        same generation contemporaries of Jin Guangyao, start their names with the character 'Zi', unlike Jin Guangyao, starting 
                        with 'Guang' like his father, putting him in an awkward position and essentially removing him from line of succession.

                        Jin Guangyao and Jin Zixuan, ironically were both born on the same day. When Meng Yao was trying to meet Jin Guangshan 
                        on the date of his birth, people were celebrating Jin Zixuan's birth. Meng Yao on the other hand, was thrown from the 
                        stairs by the Jin on the day of his birth, after his mother died.

                    <p>
                        What broke Meng Yao was Jin Guangshan's slight against his mother. One time, when Jin Guangshan was hanging out with 
                        prostitutes, he ended up talking about Meng Shi, Meng Yao's mother while Jin Guangyao was present. Essentially, he 
                        was talking about Meng Shi like she was just troublesome for being able to read, an afterthought, nothing. His mother who waited for Jin Guangshan until her death, 
                        just nothing, someone his father barely remembered. Him and his mother were nothing to Jin Guangshan, he would never be loved. 
                        So he orchestrated his death by being serviced by prostitutes till he died, fitting for scum like Jin Guangshan.

                        Of course, Jin Guangyao killed the prostitutes he used to kill Jin Guangshan, except one. This one prostitute contributed 
                        to his downfall, she is named Sisi. Wei Wuxian saw the memory from a flashback that Sisi helped him and his mother when they 
                        were being harrassed, concluding that this might be the reason he spared her.
