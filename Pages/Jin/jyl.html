            <h3>Jiang Yanli</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Jiang Yanli, the eldest daughter of Jiang Fengmian and Yu Ziyuan, was raised in Lotus Pier alongside her younger brother, Jiang Cheng,
                and Wei Wuxian, the head disciple of the Yunmeng Jiang Sect. Gentle and nurturing, Jiang Yanli served as a stabilizing presence within her 
                family, despite the tensions caused by her parents' strained marriage. Her deep love and care for her brothers were constants in her life, 
                even as the world around her became increasingly tumultuous. 
                <br><br> 
                Jiang Yanli's engagement to Jin Zixuan, the heir of the Lanling Jin Sect, was arranged early in her life. However, their betrothal was 
                dissolved after a heated altercation in which Wei Wuxian defended her honor by fighting Jin Zixuan, who had insulted her. When Lotus Pier was 
                massacred by the Wen Clan, Jiang Yanli was away visiting her relatives at the Meishan Yu Clan. After the tragedy, she rejoined her brothers 
                and contributed to the war effort in her own way. With her low cultivation, she often prepared meals for the cultivators, including during 
                the campaign at Langya to assist the Lanling Jin Clan. Her kindness led her to prepare soup for Jiang Cheng, Wei Wuxian, and Jin Zixuan every 
                night. However, because she did not leave her name, Jin Zixuan mistakenly credited another woman for the gesture. When he discovered Jiang 
                Yanli in his quarters, he accused her of stealing the credit, causing her to burst into tears. This misunderstanding was resolved only after 
                Wei Wuxian confronted Jin Zixuan, nearly beating him before Jiang Cheng, Jiang Yanli, and even Jin Guangshan intervened. Following this 
                incident, Jiang Yanli refused to acknowledge Jin Zixuan for the remainder of the campaign.  
                <br><br>
                After the Sunshot Campaign, Jin Zixuan worked to make amends for his earlier behavior, eventually winning Jiang Yanli's forgiveness and 
                affection. Their relationship blossomed into mutual love, leading to their marriage and the birth of their son, Jin Ling. Before her wedding, 
                Jiang Yanli visited Wei Wuxian in Yiling to share her joy by showing him her wedding robes.   
                <br><br>
                Tragedy struck during Jin Ling's 100-day celebration when tensions between Wei Wuxian and the cultivation sects escalated. Not long after, 
                Jin Zixuan was killed in the ambush set up by Jin Zixun to kill Wei Wuxian. Devastated by her husband's death, Jiang Yanli mourned deeply.
                In the climactic events at the Nightless City, Jiang Yanli went to the battlefield, hoping to stop Wei Wuxian from further conflict. 
                During the chaos, she sacrificed her life to shield him from an attack, dying in his arms. Her final moments were filled with love, 
                calling out to Wei Wuxian even as she succumbed to her injuries.
