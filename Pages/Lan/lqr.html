            <h3>Lan Qiren</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Lan Qiren is a strict and rule-focused elder of the Gusu Lan Clan. After Qingheng-Jun's withdrawal, Lan Qiren raised his nephews, 
                Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji, teaching them strictly to prevent repeating their father's mistakes. He allowed them to visit their mother 
                monthly but stopped after her death. He also ended up becoming the acting sect leader until Xichen came of age. 
                <br><br>
                As a teacher, Lan Qiren became renowned for producing excellent cultivators. He struggled with Wei Wuxian's disregard for rules and his 
                interest in demonic cultivation, leading to conflicts during Wei Wuxian's stay at the Cloud Recesses. Despite Wei Wuxian being a 
                troublemaker, he still got exceptional marks. He participated in the First and Second Sieges of the Burial Mounds, opposing Wei Wuxian's actions.
                They never listened to Wei Wuxian's side of the story and just proceeded to try to kill the person who turned the tide of the Sunshot Campaign. 
                During the start of the case of the dismembered fierce corpse, Lan Qiren tried to seal the dismembered arm at first but he was not strong enough 
                to contain it. With the help of Wei Wuxian in Mo Xuanyu's body which is why he was not identified and Lan Wangji only was he able to 
                suppress it.  
                He also helped identify that the Moling Su are using music from the Lan's Forbidden library when people noticed that they were playing differently.
                Lan Wangji only broke the rules trying to protect Wei Wuxian from his own clan, making Lan Qiren fear that Lan Wangji became 
                like his father who defended his mother who killed a Gusu Lan elder by marrying her.
                <br><br>
                In later years, Lan Qiren tolerated Wei Wuxian's presence in the Cloud Recesses due to Lan Wangji but avoided interacting with
                him. He is so disinclined to interacting with Wei Wuxian that he made a rule after Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji eloped that 
                forbid people from interacting with Wei Wuxian. He maintained his focus on upholding the clan's rules and reputation. His nephews love him despite him being against Wei Wuxian 
                as well as the one who let the punishment of whipping Lan Wangji with 33 lashes which rendered him bedridden for a long time.

                        himself. They were only saved due to Cangse Sanren's abilities. 
                        Cangse Sanren being angry about the incident, managed to cut off his beard.
