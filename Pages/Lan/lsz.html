            <h3>Lan Sizhui</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Born into chaos during the downfall of the Wen Clan, his earliest years were spent in the 
                Burial Mounds under the care of the Wen remnants and Wei Wuxian, who treated him with warmth 
                and kindness despite their dire circumstances. Wen Yuan's innocent laughter and curiosity brought 
                rare joy to the somber Burial Mounds, where Wei Wuxian lovingly played with him and affectionately 
                called him "A-Yuan". During their stay in the Burial Mounds, A-Yuan sometimes joins Wei Wuxian when he 
                goes down to Yiling to get necessities. In one of these outings, they get separated and Lan Sizhui mistakes 
                a cultivator as his daddy, this happens to be Lan Wangji who tried to visit Wei Wuxian on a guise of a nighthunt.
                Lan Wangji bought him toys when Wei Wuxian didn't buy him any after asking if he wanted toys due to their tight 
                situation. This encounter ended after an alarm was triggered about Wen Ning being out of control and with the 
                help of Lan Wangji, his consciousness returned and that was the last Wen Yuan saw Lan Wangji for a long time. 
                <br><br>
                Tragedy struck when the Wen remnants were massacred by the cultivation clans. Wei Wuxian, in an act of 
                desperation and love, hid A-Yuan away to save him from certain death. Lan Wangji discovered the 
                sick child during the aftermath, and recognizing the weight of Wei Wuxian's sacrifice, took A-Yuan 
                into the Lan Clan. Renamed Lan Yuan, he was raised with discipline and care in the Gusu Lan Sect, where 
                Lan Wangji became a father figure to him. However, Lan Sizhui's memories of his life in the Burial Mounds 
                faded, leaving only an intangible sense of longing.
                <br> <br>
                Years later, during their visit to
                the Mo Manor, where Wei Wuxian was resurrected in Mo Xuanyu's body, Lan Sizhui displayed his skill which 
                made Wei Wuxian praise the one who raised him. He also is great in handling situations that need tact such as 
                addressing Jiang Wanyin who wanted to take Wei Wuxian in Mo Xuanyu's body away.
                <br><br>
                In Yi City, along with Jin Rulan, Lan Jingyi, and Ouyang Zizhen, they dealt with Xue Yang's scheme. They got 
                captured by Xue Yang and caught corpse poisoning and were held hostage by Xue Yang asking for Wei Wuxian to help 
                him revive Xiao Xingchen. They eventually got saved but were poisoned. These juniors observed how Lan Wangji 
                acted around 'Mo Xuanyu' as they cooked porridge to cure them. Wei Wuxian made a very spicy porridge and 
                upon eating this, Lan Sizhui said that, the taste was 'familiar', which Lan Wangji took notice of but made no comment. 
                While Lan Wangji was fighting Xue Yang and Wei Wuxian was using his techniques to easily fend off the countless 
                fierce corpses made by Xue Yang, Lan Sizhui told him that he was very similar to Lan Wangji, which Wei Wuxian denied. 
                Sizhui meant it in the way that their mere presence gives him comfort, that somehow, everything would be alright. 
                <br><br>
                Fate led Lan Sizhui back to the Burial Mounds, where he and his companions were kidnapped. As the barriers 
                broke and fierce corpses attacked, an unexpected twist brought clarity to Lan Sizhui's past. The Wen remnants,
                preserved in the blood pool, emerged to protect them. This encounter triggered the return of his buried 
                memories. Finally understanding his origins, Lan Sizhui embraced both his past and his present. Though the Wen Clan
                was gone, their love and sacrifices lived on in him. After the events of the story, he accompanied Wen Ning
                to Dafan Village, after telling Wei Wuxian that he remembered him.
