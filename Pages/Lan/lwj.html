            <h3>Lan Wangji - Youth </h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Lan Wangji is the second heir of Gusu Lan. Lan Qiren was the one who mainly raised him and Lan Xichen. 
                Every month, they get to visit their mother once because she is confined for murdering a Gusu Lan elder 
                so their father who loves her, married her to protect her. During these visits, they get to bond, Lan Wangji's 
                mother liked to tease him and pinch his cheeks. Lan Wangji was a stubborn boy, evident when his mother died, he stayed 
                outside her house for months hoping for her to let him in. 
                <br><br>
                Lan Wangji grew up to be an exemplary student and Lan Qiren's pride along with his brother. One time when he is
                guarding Cloud Recesses during the student lectures, he obstructs a student trying to get in after curfew while 
                carrying alcohol. This rule-breaker offers him the wine but he refuses. Still, the student drinks outside 
                Cloud Recesses trying to find a loophole in the rules. Lan Wangji attacks him and surprisingly, the student was brilliant
                the fight ended up with him getting dragged out of the compound by the student. Technically, he was also out at curfew joked 
                the student. They both ended up receiving punishment, which made the student feel bad for him. 
                <br><br>
                During the lectures, the student, Wei Wuxian, tried very hard to get his attention. They both ended up 
                calling each other by their birth names, Wei Ying, and Lan Zhan. Wei Wuxian was a notorious rule breaker, 
                but at the same time, he was brilliant, excelling in the subjects effortlessly. Wei Wuxian and the Yunmeng 
                Jiang disciples also helped them with the sudden attacks of water ghouls thus the Jiang disciples' experience in 
                dealing with water ghouls was a much appreciated help. They later find out that a Waterborne Abyss was the cause of this.
                Wei Wuxian saved a disciple who couldn't fly on his sword but falls after saving him. Lan Wangji ended up being the one 
                to save Wei Wuxian who was overjoyed Lan Wangji saved him. They spent most of their time 
                in the library, where Lan Wangji supervised his punishments. Wei Wuxian always tries to get Lan Wangji's attention, 
                but Lan Wangji often just replies curtly. Wei Wuxian gave him bunnies as presents for the end of the punishment 
                which unbeknownst to Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji raised in the backhills. Wei Wuxian sooner was kicked out for fighting 
                with Jin Zixuan. 
                <br><br>
                The Wens next hosted an intersect archery competition. There the Lan Clan displayed their skills. Lan Wangji while 
                participating was approached by Wei Wuxian after Wen Chao attempted to cheat. Wei Wuxian touched his forehead ribbon 
                because it was askew. Lan Wangji upon feeling Wei Wuxian touch his ribbon, glared at him and in his overwhelming 
                feelings, crushed his bow. He left the competition early and despite this, he won the fourth place. Lan Xichen 
                got second, and Wei Wuxian got the first.
                <br><br>
                Cloud Recesses was burned by the Wens and Lan Wangji got his leg broken from the attack. On top of that, 
                he was forced to attend the Wen Indoctrination. During their stay, Wei Wuxian often tried to help him, but Lan 
                Wangji brushed him off. When they were in the territory of the Xuanwu of Slaughter, Wen Chao's mistress commanded 
                them to use Luo Qingyang as live bait. Lan Wangji and Jin Zixuan stood up for her. They were in a standstill until 
                Wei Wuxian took Wen Chao hostage, this put a stop to the call for live bait. The commotion however, disturbed 
                the Xuanwu. In the commotion, Wen Chao escaped and trapped the sect heirs in the cave, leaving them to die. 
                Wei Wuxian distracted the monster and asked Jiang Cheng and other skilled swimmers to escape through an 
                underwater cave they found. Lan Wangji stayed with Wei Wuxian, and they retreated first to treat their injuries. 
                There, Lan Wangji poured out his feelings, crying about his sect and family to Wei Wuxian. He also bit Wei Wuxian.
                They then teamed up to kill the Xuanwu of Slaughter using the Lan's Chord Assassination technique. Wei Wuxian 
                while waiting for reinforcements and rescue with him was getting weary. While he was about to sleep, he asked Lan Wangji to 
                play him a song. After they were rescued, Lan Wangji left for Cloud Recesses,

            <h3>Lan Wangji - Sunshot Campaign and Onwards</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Lan Wangji at the start of the Sunshot Campaign was looking for Wei Wuxian since Lotus Pier was 
                massacred after the Wen indoctrination. He looked for him with Jiang Wanyin. On a mission to hunt 
                Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu, they find a trail of Wen cultivators dead in horrific fashions. They have strange 
                talismans that when Lan Wangji analyzed, was reversed to summon evil. At the end of the trail, they find out that 
                Wei Wuxian was the one who did it and he was torturing Wen Chao. Lan Wangji asked Wei Wuxian to come back to Gusu 
                but Wei Wuxian interpreted it as him bringing him back to be punished so he refused. Throughout Sunshot, 
                they would have similar arguments with Wei Wuxian misunderstanding.
                <br><br>
                After they have won the war, the sects were rebuilding and celebrating. He visits Yunmeng and there, Wei Wuxian 
                gives him a flower. After that, in a Jin banquet, he sees Wei Wuxian demand the location of the Wen Remnants. 
                He follows him and what he came upon is Wen Ning killing the Jin Sect cultivators. He defends the Jin cultivators, effectively 
                standing against Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian gets more enraged when he fails to get revenge for the Wen Remnants. 
                They end up leaving Lan Wangji and the rest of the cultivators watching them. During the discussion conference, 
                he speaks up to defend Wei Wuxian. Luo Qingyang defends Wei Wuxian in the conference but gets mocked, making her 
                be disillusioned, she ended up leaving her sect and Lan Wangji pays her respect. 
                <br><br>
                After a while, Lan Wangji visits Yiling hoping to see Wei Wuxian under the guise of a nearby night hunt. Wei Wuxian 
                was said to have brought the Wens there. He encounters a child who mistook him for his father and it caused a commotion. 
                It turns out, the child, A-Yuan was with Wei Wuxian and they ended up eating together. Suddenly, an alarm got triggered so 
                his lunch with Wei Wuxian got cut off. The alarm was for Wen Ning, who got into a rampage, but with his help, they managed to 
                return Wen Ning's consciousness. They then part ways at the end after talking about how Wei Wuxian was aware of the politicking. 
                He was saying that there was no other path and he is never gonna give up the Wens who were innocent while Lan Wangji has duties to 
                his sect.
                <br><br>
                Lan Wangji helped Wei Wuxian get an invitation to Jin Rulan's 100-day Celebration. However, Wei Wuxian never got to attend because 
                he was ambushed by Jin Zixun and in the skirmish, Jin Zixuan died. The sects made a deal to let things go if Wen Ning and Wen Qing 
                surrender. The Wens complied, but the sects backed down after getting rid of them, which enraged Wei Wuxian who tried to catch up.
                Wei Wuxian was attacked while talking and then he defended himself, which started the Massacre of Night City. Lan Wangji tried to 
                stop Wei Wuxian from attacking the people who were trying to kill him, fueling Wei Wuxian's assumption that Lan Wangji hated him. 
                In the end of the fight, Jiang Yanli died trying to protect Wei Wuxian which made Wei Wuxian become overwhelmed with emotions and 
                use his Stygian Tiger Seal. Wei Wuxian was exhausted at the end of the battle, Lan Wangji was too. Using the remaining power of his core,
                he brought Wei Wuxian back to Yiling. Wei Wuxian was delirious during the time Lan Wangji confessed his love for him. All Wei 
                Wuxian said in repeat was, 'Get Lost!', unaware of everything around him. He did not hear Lan Wangji. 33 Gusu Lan elders along with 
                Lan Xichen and Lan Qiren followed them. Lan Wangji stood up against them all, injuring the 33 elders. In the end, he left Wei Wuxian in the 
                Burial Mounds and returned for punishment.
                <br> <br>
                Lan Wangji received 33 hits from the discipline whip for injuring the 33 elders. This incapacitated Lan Wangji for a while. During this time, 
                the Burial Mounds was Sieged. Upon hearing Wei Wuxian's death, Lan Wangji, still injured, came to the Burial Mounds and found a sick A-Yuan. 
                He brought him home and gave him the name Lan Yuan.

            <h3>Lan Wangji - Wei Wuxian's Return</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                It had been 13 years after Wei Wuxian's death. Lan Wangji tried to live in the way he thought Wei Wuxian would live by. 
                It took a while for Lan Wangji to be able to move with ease after the 33 whips against his back. Lan Wangji stood as a father 
                figure to Lan Sizhui. Upon responding to a signal for help in the Mo Manor, he learns of a dismembered arm that is notably powerful. They then 
                go to Dafan Mountain.
                <br><br>
                Lan Wangji hears a cultivator that plays a particular song who also controls the Ghost General Wen Ning. He defends this man, 
                'Mo Xuanyu', who helped Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi with the fierce corpse from the Mo Manor, from Jiang Wanyin who planned to 
                take him away - people who were abducted by him were never seen again - 'Mo Xuanyu', attempted to shake them off by saying 
                Jiang Wangyin was not his type, but Lan Wangji was his type. Lan Wangji obliges and this time, he comes back to Gusu, with 
                'Mo Xuanyu'. 
                <br><br>
                He lets 'Mo Xuanyu' pretend to be 'Mo Xuanyu' for a while allowing him to act more scandalously in hopes that Lan Wangji will drive him away. 
                Lan Wangji will never let that happen this time. When they investigate the Stone Castles of the Nie Sect, 'Mo Xuanyu' saves Jin Rulan, 
                transferring his curse onto himself. Lan Wangji upon seeing this slips up in worry and calls him, 'Wei Ying!'. Wei Wuxian asks him how he 
                knew his identity and Lan Wangji asks him to find it out himself. They then go to Yi City and they fight Xue Yang. There they find out the 
                tragedy of Xiao Xingchen, Song Zichen and Xue Chengmei.
                <br> <br>
                They then attend the Jin Conference where Wei Wuxian's identity gets exposed. Lan Wangji firmly stood by his side and they escaped towards Gusu. 
                Wei Wuxian saw Nie Mingjue's head in Jin Guangyao's secret chambers which they told Wei Wuxian, but they were brushed off, as Lan Xichen 
                trusts Jin Guangyao. They then go to the Burial Mounds to save the kidnapped juniors but after saving them, they encounter the cultivators 
                who are trying to siege the Burial Mounds. Wei Wuxian gets falsely accused again, and Lan Wangji again, defends him, saying that Wei Wuxian was 
                innocent. In the end, the Wen Remnants from the blood pool murdered by the cultivators ultimately rose and saved their murderers from the fierce corpses. 
                <br> <br>
                The next destination is Yunmeng where the cultivators took a break for a while. Jin Guangyao's crimes became more evident since witnesses 
                were brought in. While in Lotus Pier, Wen Ning reveals the truth that the golden core in Jiang Wanyin was given to him by Wei Wuxian with the 
                help of Wen Qing because Jiang Wanyin was being hostile and attacking them as they were leaving. The next place of interest is Yunping
                since Wei Wuxian saw the property title in Jin Guangyao's room. The Guanyin Temple was suspicious as it was previously a brothel, before 
                going there though, they stayed at an inn.
                <br> <br>
                Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian drink together. Being a Lan, Lan Wangji gets drunk easily. He ends up collecting juujubes for Wei Wuxian as well as 
                giving him two chickens he stole. Lan Wangji also makes a carving saying 'Lan Wangji was here'. Wei Wuxian offers to bathe him and becomes suggestive. 
                They ended up breaking the tub and pleasuring each other with their hands. After the deed is done, there is a misunderstanding that Lan Wangji 
                only did it out of drunkenness and for Wei Wuxian, it was nothing. They get separate rooms afterwards and Wei Wuxian ends up investigating 
                on Guanyin Temple.
                <br><br>
                Jin Guangyao is in the temple, with Lan Xichen's core sealed. Jin Rulan is also spying but he gets attacked, so Wei Wuxian protects him, exposing 
                himself in the process. Wei Wuxian becomes a hostage when Lan Wangji arrives, and out of nowhere, he says,
                <br><br>
                <b>"Lan Zhan! Lan Wangji! Hanguang-Jun! Back then, I - I really wanted to sleep with you!"</b>
                <br><br>
                Jin Guangyao, in shock, releases Wei Wuxian, who immediately hugs Lan Wangji, trying to repeat what he said but Lan Xichen interrupts them. 
                It starts to rain so they get in the temple. The truths were exposed, Jin Guangyao admits his crimes. Nie Mingjue's fierce corpse awakens, 
                now fully assembled and tries to kill those of Jin blood. With them working together, they manage to seal Nie Mingjue in a coffin. Jin Guangyao 
                is still alive but he lost an arm. Lan Xichen tries to give him medicine but as he was trying to get the medicine, turned back from Jin 
                Guangyao, Nie Huaisang screams that Jin Guangyao will attack. Lan Xichen got tricked into killing Jin Guangyao, which spills blood and disturbs the array 
                that sealed Nie Mingjue's fierce corpse. For one last time, Nie Mingjue gets out and takes Jin Guangyao with him, Lan Wangji makes a statue 
                fall over the coffin to seal it. 
                <br><br>
                After the events of the Guanyin Temple, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji eloped and travelled for a while.

                        Like all Lan Clan members, Lan Wangji cannot hold his alcohol. 
                        The author, MXTX thought that it would be nice if the top were to become childish when 
                        under the influence of alcohol.

                        The author initially intended for Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen to be twins but was scrapped. Instead, 
                        Lan Xichen became the big brother and Lan Wangji, the younger brother.

                        Lan Xichen is ranked first. <br>
