            <h3>Lan Xichen</h3>
            <p class="justify">
                Lan Xichen is the older brother of Lan Wangji and the Sect Leader of Gusu Lan. In their youth, they were both raised by Lan Qiren.
                Their father saved their mother by marrying her because she killed a Lan Sect elder. No one knows what happened, but their mother 
                ended up being confined in the Gentian House in Cloud Recesses. Lan Xichen and Lan Wangji are only allowed to 
                visit their mother once a month. They loved those visits where their mother pays attention to them. 
                <br><br>
                He is a good friend of the Nie Sect Leader Nie Mingjue. During the lectures where Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji met, 
                he encouraged Lan Wangji to socialize more. He thought that Wei Wuxian would be a good influence to him since he 
                could see how affected Lan Wangji was of Wei Wuxian. Unfortunately, when the Cloud Recesses was burned, their 
                father died from injuries and Lan Wangji got his leg broken. Lan Xichen managed to save clan secret texts and the 
                like from being destroyed. As he was on the run with the Wens, he met Meng Yao. 
                <br><br>
                Meng Yao helped him hide from the Wens, which he would be very grateful for. Meng Yao and Nie Mingjue would be closer 
                because Nie Mingjue saw how competent Meng Yao was, he also defended Meng Yao from those insulting him. These three
                became closer as the war raged on, training and planning together. It came to a close when Nie Mingjue helped 
                Meng Yao to be a part of the Jins through a recommendation letter but when he looked for him when he visited the Jins, 
                Meng Yao was nowhere, when he found him in the battlefield, he was murdering someone. Nie Mingjue knew this because 
                Meng Yao was making it look like the Wen killed the Jin disciple who insulted him by using a Wen technique with a 
                Wen sword. He tried to kill Meng Yao, but he escaped. Lan Xichen upon hearing about this insisted that there is something 
                more to Meng Yao's story.
                <br><br>
                Lan Xichen came upon a spy during the Sunshot Campaign whose intel was very helpful. One time, it proved false, and Nie Mingjue 
                was captured. He found Meng Yao to be the right hand man and in front of Wen Ruohan, tortured him and killed his subordinates. 
                When he fainted as a prisoner, he woke up with Meng Yao getting him out of Nightless City. Wen Ruohan was betrayed 
                and got stabbed in the back by Meng Yao. After Wen Ruohan's death, Nie Mingjue tries to kill Meng Yao, but Lan Xichen 
                defends him again, saying he was the spy that gave them the intel. Nie Mingjue lets it go.

                <p>
                    Post Sunshot, Lan Xichen formed a sworn brotherhood with these two, and together they are the Venerated Triad. Lan 
                Xichen essentially became the mediator between these two. Lan Xichen always took Meng Yao's side. When Nie Mingjue was angered 
                that the Jins were hosting Xue Yang who was a serial killer, he confronted Jin Guangyao, which escalated into him 
                trying to kill him again. Again, Xichen mediated and took Jin Guangyao's side. Lan Xichen was worried about Nie Mingjue's 
                mood because of his cultivation so he shared his clan's well-guarded musical piece to try to help him. He taught Meng Yao 
                how to play this and asked him to play it for Nie Mingjue, hoping to make his sworn brothers that often try to kill each other 
                get along. Unfortunately, Nie Mingjue dies of qi deviation, as Jin Guangyao was playing a song for his deadly condition. 
                <br><br>
                After Wei Wuxian got resurrected in Mo Xuanyu's body, he had suspicions early on that Wei Wuxian really got 
                revived because of Lan Wangji's change in demeanor and his obvious indulgent behavior to 'Mo Xuanyu'. When 
                Wei Wuxian's identity got exposed in Koi Tower, he was quite passive, and let him and Lan Wangji escape. 
                He met them in Cloud Recesses, where Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji tell him that Nie Mingjue's head was found in 
                Jin Guangyao's secret room. Lan Xichen again, took his side, saying both him and Lan Wangji did not see it for themselves,
                Lan Wangji trusts Wei Wuxian, he on the other hand, trusts Jin Guangyao, and they left it at that. Jin Guangyao 
                later came to give back his jade token. When Wei Wuxian sees them again, it is in Guanyin Temple, where they 
                are held hostage by Jin Guangyao. At this point, even Jin Guangyao knows how much Lan Wangji loves Wei Wuxian, assuming 
                they are so close to each other that Lan Wangji will soon come. Wei Wuxian, was quite unbelieving of this, which 
                angered Lan Xichen. He told him how Lan Wangji took care of him and defended him after he defended himself from the 
                clans who backed out on their agreement to leave the Wen Remnants alone after murdering Wen Qing and Wen Ning. He said that 
                Lan Wangji's only mistake was Wei Wuxian. Right after that, when Wei Wuxian learns that Lan Wangji loves him, he immediately confesses. 
                During the Guanyin hostage, Lan Xichen learns of the crimes that Meng Yao committed. Eventually, Meng Yao was 
                stopped and they sealed Nie Mingjue's corpse in a coffin. Jin Guangyao was injured but he can live, but Lan Xichen, torn 
                between his friend and justice told him not to do anything or else he will be killed and went to get medicine, facing away from him. 
                In this vital moment, Nie Huaisang tricks Xichen into killing Jin Guangyao by shouting that Jin Guangyao was gonna attack. 
                Lan Xichen accidentally stabs Jin Guangyao fatally, Jin Guangyao shouts at him how he did nothing. On his dying 
                breaths, he said how he did a lot of terrible things, killed his father, his wife, his child, his brother, his master, and many more 
                but the only one he never thought of harming was him. Nie Mingjue's seal was lifted because it was disturbed and was targetting 
                Jin Guangyao. Jin Guangyao tried to drag Lan Xichen down with him and asked him to die with him, and Xichen let him, 
                Jin Guangyao saw Xichen oblige to his demand and had a last minute change of heart, pushing him away.

                        Like all Lan Clan members, Lan Xichen cannot hold his alcohol. 
                        He drank with Lan Wangji once when he drank Emperor's Smile during the time that Wei Wuxian died. 
                        they made a ruckus in Cloud Recesses, messing up the place, letting Lan Wangji carve on the Wall of Rules.
                        According to the author, when Lan Xichen gets drunk, he becomes so excited 
                        that every sentence he speaks ends with three exclamation marks.
